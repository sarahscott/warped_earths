    quotes: [
      "Fordism wasn’t an American thing. It was a logic of manipulating all sorts of economic power all over the world to get supply chains choreographed and organized.",
      "The car evolves from the four legged bicycle. It's part of a much bigger boom, it's also not like Ford is just a genius alone in his garage. It's very similar to the kind of Silicon Valley understanding that like, Detroit is the Silicon Valley, there's a huge ecosystem: there's investors, there's startups, there's all sorts of people in this space. And there's a huge ecology of machinery, labor, talent, venture funding, etc.",
      `The amount of space that's taken up on the planet Earth, by cars, and that could be from driving to parking, to maintenance, to the broader geological implications of petrol "asphaltization," and the ways in which roads actually do slice up the entire planetary ecosystem from flora and fauna to like species propagation, etc. It is cuts through the Earth, but they're they're also conduits. As much as something separates the ability for ecologies to flourish, often conduits are often the place where ecologies most often flourish.`,
      "(On Fordlandia) It's also at a moment for the company where they're thinking more about social projects. It's like there was that moment where we thought Mark Zuckerberg was going to start Zucktown. And everybody was kind of making these little microcosms for their idealized tech utopias, rather than realizing that the project that they had built was at global scale.",

    description:
      "LIMINAL SPACE BETWEEN WARRING POWERS // TECHNOLOGY AS INVASION",
    quotes: [
      "The revolutionary belief in an endlessly flexible and malleable world is replaced by an inquiry into the limits of knowledge and change and inquiry into reality, indifferent to human desires.",
      "Intellectuals and artists in Poland (or any territory that modernized under occupation, and under war or violence) were able to notice something about technology that is universal, which is the idea of technology as an invasion, or an alien logic coming from without.",
      "The recurring theme of technological systems evolving to full autonomy and bypassing humans entirely might originate from Lem’s position as a Polish citizen, first living through the trauma of Nazism, and then communism, and then caught in the midst of the American Soviet technological war, which happened over Poland rather than in Poland, Poland being quite removed from it and occupied at that time.",
      "So there's obviously, in the 1970s, a language barrier problem and a political problem because of the cold war, and more importantly, intellectuals from Eastern Europe or East Asia for that fact were facing very different political and cultural conditions than the west at the time when philosophy of AI was taking off. So socially when the West was preoccupied, at that time, with youth movements and protests and revolutions, Eastern Europe and East Asia were in the next phase of this process: the hangover and calm down from revolutions. Numerous intellectuals in Poland watched the regime's they empowered in the interest of stopping the rise of fascism actually turned authoritarian and totalitarian themselves, arresting and assassinating their friends, colonizing and exploiting vulnerable populations, and dramatically restricting art and philosophy within structures of a police state. In consequence, much of the writing in Poland at that time tries to dissect how and why people fall prey to this form of ideological thinking that took hold in the mid 20th century.",

      "BACK AND FORTH // GENERATIVE MISUNDERSTANDINGS & CONTINGENCIES",
    quotes: [
      "You can see there is a Chinese presence in these stories that we perceive to be very western, very American even often, and that determine how we perceive and handle the world still today. ",
      "When we try to assign certain developments to certain people or groups of people or cultures, we find ideas that are sort of emergent, they're bubbling up all around the world. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it's a bit contingent where it really comes to fruition, who picks up the ball and does it in the end.",
      "I think we can really imagine this as an episode of very constructive intercultural knowledge transmission where something quite amazing happened. They work together without the constraints of power structures, or religion, mostly in belief systems, and translate it back and forth. ... So far, it's sort of a Western success story. You know, Jesuits come to China. And they bring smart stuff with them, and the Chinese use it and everyone's happy. But transmissions go both ways. It's very important that we design methods to look at how these transmissions work, besides the narratives that we've come to accept.",
      "This is such a significant moment, a rift in this history, it could have led to an entirely different world than the one that we're looking at at the moment, it still makes me angry to think about it, because you have to keep in mind that at that time, Europe, but also Russia, were starting to connect in a whole new academic way. The Royal Academy was being built...the Academie Francaise was built St. Petersburg, Moscow. And they were establishing a new network outside of the reach of the court, outside of the reach of the church. ...and the next node in this network would have been Beijing.",
