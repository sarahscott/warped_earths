  title: "Overview Dispatch 0.0.1",
  intro: `The "Overview Effect," a concept introduced by space philosopher Frank White, describes the profound change in perception that astronauts undergo when they gaze upon the interconnected and interdependent condition of the Earth from above. This perspective is mirrored in globalist optimism of the early internet, which often imagined the potential to transform the world into a "global village." The internet was seen as a tool to facilitate smooth flows of information and connectivity, painting the virtual realm as a seamless extension of the physical world.
  \nHowever, the virtual and physical are inextricably linked. Planetary-scale computation demands a substantial material infrastructure that draws upon and warps the material conditions of the planet. The imbalances which both produce and arise from these developments in computation have led to new plural concentrations of material and cultural flows, generating skewed axes that shape and influencing the course of planetary politics.
